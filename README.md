# Capstone with Government of Canada (Canada Data Analytics Team)

## Description

Our capstone partner is the Canada Digital Analytics Team. The task is to help the websites visitors to more easily access to the information they are looking for. Visitors could fill a form when they encounter a problem (e.g. they could not find the information they want) and their feedback is then collected as text comments. We will build a multi-class classification model to predict the tag which could identify visitor's purpose. The hierarchy and classes of tags are given by our partner in Government of Canada. We are also open to improve the classes of tags using computational ligustic techniques we have learned in MDS-CL courses in a later stage of the project.

By the end of the project, our data product will enable our capstone partner to use state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques to label visitor responses. Processing can be done a larger scale, at a higher speed, and at a lower cost. This may, in turn, help the stakeholders to better understand what people visit their website to do.
