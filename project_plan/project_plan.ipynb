    "\n",
    "Our industry partner is the Canada Digital Analytics Team. They want to help the websites visitors to more easily access to the information they are looking for. Visitors could fill a form when they face problem to find the information and their open feedbacks are then collected as text comments. We would build a multi-class classification to predict the tag which could identify visitor's purpose. The hierarchy and classes of tags are given by our partner in Canada Government. We are also open to improve the classes of tags by somen computational ligustic techniques we learn in MDS-CL courses in a later stage of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the project, our data product will enable our industry partner to use state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques to label visitor responses. Processing can be done a larger scale, at a higher speed, and at a lower cost. This may, in turn, help the stakeholders to better understand what people visit their website to do."

Each column corresponds to information about the user's problem given the survey. Date is simply the date when the survey was filled by the user. Comment is the answer to the open response field of the survey that allows users to elaborate more on what they were after from the website. Problem shows the type of problem the user has. URL is the link where the user filled the survey. Language is either English or French. Institution is the government body that is most concerned with the user's problem.

    "## 4. Methods \n",
    "The main task of this project is to predict and generate the closest tags based on the comments of users when they fill the problem form in the Canada.ca websites. Because the tags are given and fixed, we would try different multi classification models to find the most suitable model. And an appropriate interface to deliver the outcomes would be included in our plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Packages and libraries\n",
    "- Numpy:  scientific computing\n",
    "- Pandas: data wrangling\n",
    "- Pytorch: machine learning frameworks\n",
    "- Altair / Matplotlib: Visualization\n",
    "- NLTK: processing the text feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Data handling\n",
    "Since the data is stored in .csv files, we would use Pandas for data preprocessing or wrangling if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Models\n",
    "There are several algorithms and off-the-shelf models of multi classification tasks. We would experiment most of them to find the most suitable one based on the giving data set.\n",
    "Dummy classifier: based on the cosine distance between the most frequent word in comment and tags.\n",
    "Decision trees: random forest, XGBoost, Light GBM\n",
    "Linear regression\n",
    "Naive bayes\n",
    "LSTM\n",
    "BERT classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Evaluation\n",
    "Because the distribution of tags is imbalanced, we would evaluate the performance of models by accuracy and f1 score.\n",
    "Accuracy\n",
    "F1 score: macro average / weighted average\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Implementation and delivery\n",
    "Source code with trained model\n",
    "Interface to generate tags based on the comments\n",
    "Document of code and interface\n",
