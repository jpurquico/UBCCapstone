Section and Theme
=================

>
> **Question:**
>
> What's the difference between section and tag?
>
> **Question about communication:**
>
> Will our industry partner be interested in joining our group channel
> on Slack?
>
> **Question:**

1.  URL column: What are the URLs for? Is it where the users came from
    > when they didn't find the answer they wanted? Or is the URL where
    > the users are supposed to go to find the answer?

2.  Institution column: Do the users already know if their problem
    > belongs to a specific institution? (e.g. the user that asked 'Am I
    > eligible for vaccination?', do they know that the problem belongs
    > to Health Canada?)

3.  Theme column: Do the users already know if the answer to their
    > problem can be found in the specific Theme?

4.  Which columns are manually annotated and which are automatically
    > generated by the survey?

5.  How do they collect the text/comments? where they write the survey?
    > Do they write the survey under the corresponding link of the URL
    > column?

6.  Do labels have hierarchy?(predefined hierarchy/labels)

7.  Are NA tags due to unfinished labeling by the annotators or did the
    > annotator intentionally put NA because the comment is
    > uncategorizable?

> **Rough Project Plan**

1.  Language detection (En/Fr) ??

2.  Multi Classification task

    a.  Get an ontology/hierarchy of tags first!

3.  Interface

    a.  upload a tsv file → generate a document with comments + tags
